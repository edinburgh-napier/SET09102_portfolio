# Documentation

This section is related to your work on clean code and documentation in week 5.

First, choose six rules of clean code and explain them. For each one,

* Summarise the rule in your own words.
* Provide an example from the code that you wrote in week 3 and then refined in week 5.
* Explain how your code implements the rule. 

Second, copy the doxygen comments from your code into your portfolio and provide some 
descriptive commentary on their purpose and structure. Use screenshots showing the HTML 
content that is generated from your code to illustrate your explanation.

Finally, highlight three examples from your code where you have eliminated the need
for comments by adhering to the principles of clean code.
