# Setup

This section documents your practical work in week 2.

The main requirements are to show that:

1. Your development environment is correctly set up
2. You understand the setup including potential alternative configuration settings

## Environment configuration

Here, you should include appropriate screenshots with additional commentary. 

**DO**

* Place your image files in the `images` folder
* Choose your screenshots carefully so that they communicate the appropriate information.
  Many screenshots with no clear purpose or with trivial differences are of little value.
* Provide <ins>descriptive</ins> commentary to explain why the screenshot is included. 
  what it shows and point out any particularly significant details.
* Modify your screenshots - for example, by adding arrows, outlines or other highlighting 
  techniques - to enhance their communication value.
* Remove unnecessary material from your screenshots such as toolbars, other windows and 
  computer desktop to eliminate distractions.
* Ensure that any important content is clearly legible. Pay particular attention to text
  size and image resolution.
* Use [numbered captions](https://towardsdev.com/3-ways-to-add-a-caption-to-an-image-using-markdown-f2ca30562be6) 
  as labels for images. Also, use the caption numbers to refer to images in your text.

**DON'T**

* Expect the reader to understand your reasons for including a screenshot. If you can't
  explain it, the screenshot will not do the job on its own.
* Include self-evident comments. For example, don't simply list the values used on a
  configuration page if those values are clearly visible in the screenshot.

## Reflection

For this section, decide what points are worth making and structure your content 
appropriately.

**DO**

* Use subheadings to differentiate between sections
* Provide <ins>reflective</ins> commentary that discusses, for example, limitations of
  your current configuration, how your configuration is appropriate for the current 
  project, alternative configuration that might be appropriate in ther circumstances, 
  etc.
* Mention any difficulties you had setting up your working environment and how you 
  resolved them

**DON'T**

* Repeat the descriptive commentary from point 1
* Give a blow-by-blow account of everything you did. Instead, you should highlight 
  the important points.
