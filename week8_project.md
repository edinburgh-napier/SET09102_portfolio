# Project work 1

In week 8, you are exercising all the principles and techniques that have been discussed 
in the module so far. Your portfolio entry should demonstrate your ability to integrate 
the various dimensions of software engineering into your practice. It should include 

* A descriptive summary of the issue that you worked on.
* Snippets from your code with commentary showing how you have used good software design 
  practice.
* A descriptive summary of the test code that you have written.
* A reflective summary of any changes that were requested during the code review along 
  with your fixes.
* A descriptive summary of any issues you found with the code that you were asked to review.
* A general reflective section that identifies, for example,
  * New things you have realised this week
  * Common problems that can arise in a team development situation
  * How your practice compares to other people's
  * etc.

Be sure to include links to the original items in the team's GitHub repository.

## Marking

The marks for this portfolio entry will be split as follows:

* Timeliness: 5 marks (one mark will be deducted for each day or partial day that the submission 
  is late).
* Description: 2 marks are awarded for the descriptive content. Please remember that this 
  material will be useful to you in the end-of-module interview, so it is in your interests to
  make the content detailed and easy to follow.
* Reflection: 3 marks are awarded for the quality of reflection. Again, you should think of this 
  as preparation for the interview assessment.
