# Project work 5

Week 12 is the fifth and last week in a series in which the goal is to improve your 
personal software engineering practice. Your portfolio entry has the same general content
as last week's, including:

* A descriptive summary of the issue that you worked on.
* Snippets from your code with commentary showing how you have used good software design 
  practice.
* A descriptive summary of the test code that you have written.
* A reflective summary of any changes that were requested during the code review along 
  with your fixes.
* A descriptive summary of any issues you found with the code that you were asked to review.
* A general reflective section that identifies, for example,
  * New things you have realised this week
  * Common problems that can arise in a team development situation
  * How your practice compares to other people's
  * etc.

Be sure to include links to the original items in the team's GitHub repository.

In the reflective sections this week, you should highlight ways that you persona practice
has improved as before. It would also be good to reflect on any improvements that have
been made to the agreed team workflow and related procedures. Are things working
better than they were? What further improvements could be made in the future?

## Marking

The marks for this portfolio entry will be split as follows:

* Timeliness: 5 marks (one mark will be deducted for each day or partial day that the submission

  as preparation for the interview assessment.
