# Requirements specification

This item summarises your work in week 11 in which you elaborated a user story and developed
specification documentation for someone else to work on.

Your portfolio entry should

* Introduce the user story
* Briefly analyse the main difficulties for the developer
* Present your specification documentation (either in full or as extracts with links to
  the full documents as appropriate)
* Reflect on how your documentation compares to the material you have been working with
  so far. Have you made any improvements?

## Marking

The marks for this portfolio entry will be split as follows:

* Timeliness: 5 marks (one mark will be deducted for each day or partial day that the submission 
  is late).
* Description: 1 mark is awarded for the descriptive content. Please remember that this 
  material will be useful to you in the end-of-module interview, so it is in your interests to
  make the content detailed and easy to follow.
* Reflection: 4 marks are awarded for the quality of reflection. Again, you should think of this 
  as preparation for the interview assessment.
