# Code review

This section documents your practical work from week 4 in which you attempt a series of 
code review challenges. For your portfolio, do the following:

1. Choose the code review challenge which best demonstrates your skills.
2. Copy the code into your portfolio using a Markdown
   [fenced code block](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).
3. Provide some descriptive commentary that identifies the problems.
4. Show your improved version of the code in a second code block.
5. Explain in one or more paragraphs why your solution is a good one.

**DO**

* Use grammatically correct sentences and paragraphs for your commentary.
* Make clear reference to the code in your commentary. GitHub Markdown does not support
  line numbers and so you need to make sure that the reader knows which line you are
  referring to from your description.
* Refer to recognised principles or rules when describing your solution. "I thought it
  would be better that way" is not sufficient: you need to have specific reasons.

**DON'T**

* Include multiple examples. Make the decision about which example shows your best
  work and use that one.
