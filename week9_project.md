# Project work 2

In week 9, you are continuing with the team project. Your portfolio entry should 
demonstrate how your software engineering practice is improving. It should include
much the same content as last week's:

* A descriptive summary of the issue that you worked on.
* Snippets from your code with commentary showing how you have used good software design 
  practice.
* A descriptive summary of the test code that you have written.
* A reflective summary of any changes that were requested during the code review along 
  with your fixes.
* A descriptive summary of any issues you found with the code that you were asked to review.
* A general reflective section that identifies, for example,
  * New things you have realised this week
  * Common problems that can arise in a team development situation
  * How your practice compares to other people's
  * etc.

Be sure to include links to the original items in the team's GitHub repository.

In the reflective sections, try to identify things that you have done better this week. 
This could include, for example,

* Better application of the principles of clean code.
* Avoiding the repetition of previous mistakes.
* More comprehensive test coverage.
* Adoption of a more systematic personal workflow.
* Improved identification of problems in other people's code.
* etc.

## Marking

The marks for this portfolio entry will be split as follows:

* Timeliness: 5 marks (one mark will be deducted for each day or partial day that the submission 
  is late).
* Description: 2 marks are awarded for the descriptive content. Please remember that this 
  material will be useful to you in the end-of-module interview, so it is in your interests to
  make the content detailed and easy to follow.
* Reflection: 3 marks are awarded for the quality of reflection. Again, you should think of this 
  as preparation for the interview assessment.
